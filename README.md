# MoveIt based collision checker + object placement

ROS based collision checker service based on an edited MoveIt core package. 

The idea is based on the work made by @pradeepr-roboticist in this [issue](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/2097).

The `moveit_core` is updated for ROS `noetic` as of **29 Apr 2022**.

_______
### Installation

My suggestion is to install `moveit_core` first from `apt`, and then override the package by installing this in your `catkin_ws`.

_______
### How it works

The main edited file in `moveit_core` is `moveit_core\collision_detection_fcl\collision_env_fcl.cpp` line [333](https://github.com/eliabntt/moveit_based_collision_checker_and_placement/blob/main/moveit_core/collision_detection_fcl/src/collision_env_fcl.cpp#L333).
This function accept in input two lists of objects, checks if the objects are in the moveit planning scene (i.e. they exists), and perform a low level collision checking request (standard moveit library).
It requires as output the distance, the contacts and the cost returning this information (lines 361-367 for those settings).

The function can be called with `planning_scene_->getCollisionEnv()->checkCollisionBetweenObjectGroups(ob_l1, ob_l2);`.
The object lists are simply the ids of the objects (strings) in the scene.

The collision checking node I developed than expose a ROS service that make use of this function.

The main purpose of the service is to PLACE objects in a given scene. It does that by random location guessing within a given perimeter and a given world.

You need to provide the stl/dae for all the objects you're going to use.

It also implements a checking procedure such that the object is placed within an ARBITRARY polygon.

There are two ways of using this service:
- single (always the same) object placement in the world: simply check collisions between the two meshes (one is in ob_l1, one is in ob_l2). The mesh of this object gets pre-loaded when the node is launched.
- multiple object placement in the world: recursevly check collisions between one mesh and the already placed ones. First iteration is `mesh1-world`, second is `mesh2-[world,mesh1]`, etc. NOTE: note that this can be used also as a single-object placement with different meshes per each iteration.

### Usage

Simply build the node.
Run `roslaunch collision_check.launch`.

This will launch:
- the collision check node
- a moveit demo scene with a `firefly` robot (generated with `moveit_setup_assistant`, based on [firefly_rotors_simulator](https://github.com/ethz-asl/rotors_simulator/blob/master/rotors_description/urdf/firefly.xacro))

The `firefly` will be used for "camera" placement, i.e. the single object placement. In the launch file you can edit the object
The service is listening at `/fake/collision_checker/check` and is defined as follows:

```
string env_stl_path # ALWAYS REQUIRED
string[] ob_names # OPTIONAL
string[] ob_stl_paths # REQUIRED IF OB_NAMES SET (can be also dae)
bool is_cam
float64 forced_z # REQUIRED -1 if NOT used, otherwise set
float64[] min_limits # REQUIRED min and max limits for the rng
float64[] max_limits
geometry_msgs/Point[] env_polygon # REQUIRED the polygon to check the in/out
int32 limit_collision # REQUIRED maximum amount of collision point detected between the meshes
bool reset # reset the environment
---
float64[] x
float64[] y
float64[] z
float64[] yaw
```

The rule is that either `is_cam` needs to be set to `TRUE` OR `ob_names` needs to be non-empty.
`is_cam` takes preference to `ob_names` (i.e. the program check `is_cam` value before proceding).
`is_cam` leads to option 1 above (one mesh checked against the environment, mesh pre-loaded).
`ob_names` (1 or more) leads to option 2 above (different meshes checked against the environment).

As I said above `is_cam` use the pre-loaded mesh (setup in the launch file as param).

When option 2 is sought `ob_stl_paths` needs to have one entry for EACH object *even when repeated* with the full absolute path of the mesh.

You need to set `min` and `max` limits for `x,y,z`, the `polygon` vertices (`x,y`). Those will be used by the uniform random number generator.

The service return the in-order `x,y,z,yaw` location found. (yaw spanning the whole circle).
IF IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO PLACE THE OBJECT THE SYSTEM USE A FIXED VALUE
```
x = max_limits.at(0) + 10;
y = max_limits.at(1) + 10;
z = -10;
yaw = 0;
```
(lines 155-158 of the code).



The workflow is as follow:
- reset the scene if required or if the env changes
- create the env if necessary (red color, ID "world")
- create the object mesh in the env
- until a valid location is found generate random x,y,z,yaw values
- check for collision
- repeat a maximum of 90 times or until the maximum amount of possible collision is satisfied
